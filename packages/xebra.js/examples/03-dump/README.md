# Dump

1. Open index.html
2. Open any Max patch

In the browser, open the Developer console (command-option-J on OS X and Chrome). Next, press the Dump button. If Max is connected, this will print all objects and parameters exposed by xebra.js to the console. This example shows how to iterate through the entirety of the state tree in xebra.js.

# Resources

1. Open max/bones.maxpat
2. Open web/index.html
3. Enter into the search box the name of some image resource in the Max search path
4. If the image is in Max's search path, it should tile the background

This example shows how to use the Resource class, which can be used to pull resources (images only, for now) from Max.

# Quickstart

1. Open max/01-quickstart.maxpat
2. Open web/index.html

The webpage will connect to Max automatically. You should see three buttons appear in the webpage. Clicking these buttons should play a note in Max. Adding additional buttons in Max should cause buttons to appear in the browser as well.

This example demostrates the very basics of creating a Xebra.State object, connecting to Max, and listening for events.

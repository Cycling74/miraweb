# p5.js

1. Open max/p5js.maxpat
2. Turn on DSP in Max
3. Open web/index.html
4. Watch the boids flock and listen to their sounds

This example shows how to use p5.js with xebra.js. The position of Boids in p5 are mapped to the value of multislider objects in Max. Each of these is used in conjunction with a poly~ object in Max to generate sound.

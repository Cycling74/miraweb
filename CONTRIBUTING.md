Contributing Guidelines
=============

## Code Style Guide

* Use tab characters for spacing
* No trailing whitespace and also blank lines should have no whitespace
* Make use of strict equals === unless type coercion is intended
* Follow conventions already established in project's source code
* Validate changes with eslint and build/test the project to make sure you didn't break anything
